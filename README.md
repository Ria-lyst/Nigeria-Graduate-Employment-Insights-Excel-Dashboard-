# Nigeria-Graduate-Employment-Insights-Excel-Dashboard-
Analyzed survey data of Nigerian graduates to uncover employment patterns, salary trends, and the impact of education on workforce outcomes. Built an Excel dashboard with pivot tables, charts, and KPIs to visualize insights across demographics, regions, and academic backgrounds.
This project explores graduate employability in Nigeria using survey data covering demographics, education, and labor market outcomes. The dataset was cleaned and structured in Excel, and key indicators were summarized using pivot tables, calculated fields, and interactive slicers.

The dashboard highlights:

Employment distribution across regions, gender, and education levels.

Salary analysis, including salary brackets, net earnings, and differences by field of study.

Impact of education (university type, GPA/class, postgraduate degree) on employment status.

Skill relevance, showing how specific technical and professional skills influence job outcomes.

By combining Excel’s advanced features with data storytelling, this project demonstrates my strengths in data cleaning, descriptive analytics, and visualization for workforce insights. The results provide a clear picture of the challenges and opportunities in Nigeria’s labor market.
